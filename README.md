## Description
Cannabis Collection is a very basic single page web application, that utilizes a Rails API backend with postgresql database and a React/Redux frontend, with room for growth. The app gives the ability to add, edit, and delete experiences one has had with certain strains of marijuana for future reference.

## Installation
To initiate the API please see instructions in the backend repo. Once the rails server is running, from the cannabis_collection_frontend directory in your terminal, run `npm install` and `npm start` to run the web application and select `y` to run the front end server on a different port.
